## What We Want to Show
- User Authentication: A secure system for user registration, login, and session management.
- Book Search Functionality: Users can search for books by entering their fields of interest and specific topics. The results are fetched from the Google Books API.
- Favorites System: Users can save their favorite books and view them later. Books can be categorized based on fields of interest.
- Reading Progress: The app allows users to save their current reading progress for each book.
- Learning Notes: Users can write and store personal learning notes for each book they have saved.
- Bookmarks: Users can bookmark books for future reference.
- Book Details: Each book includes title, author, ISBN, publication year, and a description.
- Book Recommendations: Users can add their favorite books to their collection and revisit them when needed.

## Special Operations
- Search Books by Topic: The app integrates with the Google Books API to retrieve books based on user preferences. The search is dynamic and includes fields such as interest and topic.
- Store Favorites in JSON: The user's favorite books are saved in a JSON file, allowing the user to easily manage and remove them later.
- Session Management: User sessions are managed through Flask's built-in session handling, ensuring secure access to user-specific data.
- Page Progress Update: Users can save their reading progress for each book. The app updates the page number of where the user left off reading.
- Learning Notes Storage: Personal notes for each book are stored and associated with the userâ€™s account in the JSON file, so users can record important insights or information about books.
- Remove Favorites: Users can remove multiple selected favorites from their saved list in one operation.
- Authentication and Authorization: Secure login and session management are used to restrict access to user-specific actions like adding favorites or saving progress.
